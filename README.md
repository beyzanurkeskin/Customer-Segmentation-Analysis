# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Description
This project is focused on conducting a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using various clustering techniques. It comprises two primary notebooks:

- `Part1.ipynb`: This notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. It sets the stage for the clustering analysis by preparing and exploring the dataset.

- `Part2-modeling.ipynb`: This notebook is dedicated to the implementation of clustering algorithms. It includes the application of k-means, multiple k-means ensemble, and Meta-Clustering Ensemble Scheme (MC-EMS). The clustering results are evaluated to understand customer segments.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Python can be downloaded from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: If not already installed, you can install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```

3. **Download the Notebooks**: Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebooks (`Part1.ipynb` and `Part2-modeling.ipynb`) to your local machine.

## Dependencies
This project requires several Python libraries. Install the following dependencies:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scipy**: For scientific calculations.

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running the Project
To run the project:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `Part1.ipynb` to begin with data preprocessing and exploration.
4. Proceed with `Part2-modeling.ipynb` for clustering analysis and evaluation.
